# Next with Express and Babel

## What is it?

This skeleton project is similar to [custom-server-express](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/custom-server-express), except 
it demonstrates how you would separate your client transpilation config from your both your NextJS and Express server configs.

## How to Run?

For Dev:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

For Production:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

This project defaults to live on (localhost:3000)[http://localhost:3000].
